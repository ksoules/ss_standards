Religion/Religious,Grades 6-8,History,"Anchor Standard 1, 6-8a","History Anchor Standard One: Students will employ chronological concepts in analyzing historical phenomena [Chronology]. Historical inquiry is not limited to the study of specific events, but may also focus on ideas or trends which extend across space and time. The continuing migrations of a population, the development of a religion or a philosophy, or the gradual change in the social status of a particular group all represent possible subjects for investigation. Such investigations depend heavily on the ability to construct accurate chronologies and draw logical conclusions regarding cause and effect. 6-8a: Students will examine historical materials relating to a particular region, society, or theme; analyze change over time, and make logical inferences concerning cause and effect.",,
Religion/Religious,Grades 6-8,History,"Anchor Standard 4, 6-8b","History Anchor Standard Four: Students will develop historical knowledge of major events and phenomena in world, United States, and Delaware history [Content]. An organized mental framework of events, people, trends, and other historical phenomena is essential to understanding, evaluating, and constructing historical interpretations. Such a framework allows us to draw logical inferences concerning the continuing impact of the past on the present. Individual periods, regions, or events should not be studied in isolation but rather in comparison to one another. Nor should the broad sweep of events or an emphasis on leaders, great works, and pivotal events obscure the importance of seeking to understand the everyday life of ordinary people in other times and places. 6-8b: Students will develop an understanding of ancient and medieval world history, and the continuing influence of major civilizations, including: -- The beginnings of human society -- Early civilizations and pastoral peoples (4,000-1,000 BC) -- Classical traditions, major religions, and great empires (1,000 BC--300 AD) -- Expanding zones of exchange and encounter (300-1,000 AD) --Intensified hemispheric interactions (1,000-1,500 AD)",,

Places reflect the culture of the inhabitants as well as the ways that culture has changed over time. Places also reflect the connections and flow of information, goods, and ideas with other places. Students who will live in an increasingly interconnected world need an understanding of the processes which produce distinctive places and how those places change over time. 6-8a: Students will analyze patterns of cultural activity associated with different world regions in order to explain the reasons for the cultural development of a place. 6-8b: Students will evaluate a location s site and situation in order to identify and explain the distinctive cultural and physical characteristics, patterns of trade, and interactions that make a place unique.",,
