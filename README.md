# Data Processing Goal
- normalize the data so that all states are in the same format

**Desired Components**
- key word
- grade
- course name
- standard text
- standard ID (if it exists)

*will need to determine*
- if/how to create unique identifiers
    - if we want to create a single file that can be queried instead of having to query each
    state independently
    - some states have systems and others do not
- what to do with additional info
    - theme/concept/time period

**Other issues**
- remove unwanted line breaks
- deal with unusual characters


# States to Update #
- Alabama
- Iowa
- Oklahoma?
- 


# Data Processing Part 2
- clean up keyword list
    - variations on terms (e.g. Jew, Judaism, Jewish)
    - categories of terms (religious traditions, places, concepts, people)
